For project1, it performs EDA on NYC Yellow Taxi 2020 data, utilizing pandas and numpy for data processing, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, graphviz, and networkx for data visualization, tensorflow_data_validation for data validation, fastparquet for handling data formats, and sklearn.preprocessing for feature engineering. The goal is to identify data issues, analyze feature correlations, and determine key factors affecting trip duration.

For Project 2, the objective is to predict NYC Yellow Taxi trip duration** using three deep learning models, MLP, Linear Regression, DNN, and incorporate climate data to improve prediction accuracy. The project utilizes pandas** and numpy for data processing, fastparquet for handling Parquet files, and seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, graphviz, and networkx for data visualization. Machine learning preprocessing is performed using sklearn.preprocessing, while tensorflow is employed to build and train deep learning models. Additionally, tensorflow_data_validation is used to validate the dataset. The goal is to compare different models, optimize hyperparameters, analyze training and validation loss trends, and determine the most effective model for trip duration prediction.
